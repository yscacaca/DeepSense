# Simple test on Android with TensorFlow 1.4
Due to the Conv3D operation, [the original DeepSense implementation](../deepSense_HHAR_tf.py) cannot be easily deployed on Android devices with the standard `libtensorflow_inference.so`.

[The new implementaion](./deepSense_HHAR_noConv3D_tf.py) bypasses the Conv3D with the Conv2D.

In addition, the *.pb file generated by `optimize_for_inference_lib.optimize_for_inference` will encounter error during the deployment. The current version only uses freeze graph.

## Steps
```
python deepSense_HHAR_noConv3D_tf.py
python eepSense_HHAR_noConv3D_load_save.py
python sample_model_tf_prep.py
```
